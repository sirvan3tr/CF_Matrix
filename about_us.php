          <h1>How the Matrix Works</h1>
          <hr>
          <h3>What's the whole idea behind it?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>We want The Matrix to be a guide and somewhere we can get a good overview of who is working on what.</li>
            <li>We want it to highlight where we have issues with overbooking, underbooking and be somewhere you can look to see what projects you are working on in the next days and weeks.</li>
            <li>Importantly it is also intended to help the whole team manage the work we have, so we need to trust that if something is booked it will be worked on</li>
          </ul>
          <hr>

          <h3>Who makes updates?</h3>
          <p>Currently only AMs / PMs and team leads can make amends</p>

          <h3>What is the non bookable time in my day for?</h3>
          <p>The 1.5 or 2.5 hours of your day that is not bookable is for the following tasks (not an exclusive list):<p>
          <ol>
            <li>Maintenance</li>
            <li>Helping with proposals / estimates</li>
            <li>Internal meetings</li>
            <li>Oversight</li>
            <li>Admin</li>
          </ol>

          <p>It is your responsibility to manage this additional time, we won't be scheduling the tasks in the list above (larger / urgent maintenance work aside)</p>
          <p>If you are consistently using more or less than you are allocated flag it to your manager or the AM / PM team</p>
          <hr>

          <h3>What if I don't have any of those things to do?</h3>
          <p>Then simply spend your whole day on the project or maintenance work you have been booked for.</p>
          <hr>

          <h3>What if I finish a task early?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Let the AM/PM you are working with know</li>
            <li>Move on to the next task booked in, whether that is that day or the next</li>
            <li>If you are so far ahead the next work is not ready to start let the team leads and AM/PM know and agree what you can move on to</li>
          </ul>
          <hr>

          <h3>What if I am behind schedule on a task?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Let the team lead and AM/PM know ASAP</li>
            <li>You will then be able to discuss a solution with the team</li>
          </ul>
          <hr>

          <h3>What happens if I am booked on one thing and someone asks me to do something else?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Say no</li>
            <li>Whoever is asking for that work needs to check the resource plan and haggle with whoever has you booked</li>
            <li>Your are responsible to focus on the work you are booked for</li>
          </ul>
